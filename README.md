# MonkeyPlane
MonkeyPlane is a small shoot-em up game about a monkey escaping a zoo by plane.

This project was developed in order to give me a greater grasp of the SDL2 framework, as well as giving me a better understanding of tool programming
due to this project being created along side the MonkeyPlane Level Editor tool.

## Running the Project
You will need to compile the project using VisualStudio 2022 and link the SDL2 framework to it.

## How to Use
The game allows you to control a small monkey flying a plane and shoot other animals trying to attack you. It follows the simple shoot-em up formula.
Use the arrow keys to move, the spacebar to shoot and the R key to reset the game.

## Credits
Created individually by myself in order to learn SDL2 and game development.
